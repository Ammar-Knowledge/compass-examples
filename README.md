> This repo is used for sharing example [Atlassian Forge apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/) and code snippets to help customers of [Atlassian Compass](https://www.atlassian.com/software/compass). Compass was built from the ground up with extensibility in mind so you can build the ultimate developer experience platform. Learn more about [building apps for Compass](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/compass/integrations/get-started-integrating-with-Compass/) using the Atlassian serverless app development platform Forge, our open-by-default [Compass APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/compass/graphql/), and our [Compass Forge modules](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/manifest-reference/modules/index-compass/) that provide boilerplate to help you get started building faster.
